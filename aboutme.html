						<p>Hey, my name is Damon, here is a little bit about myself. I grew up for most of my childhood in Chicago IL.
							So for most of my young life I suffered through the freezing cold until I moved to Nashville TN! I mostly remember
							living in Tennessee because I had all of my highschool there. I found my Love for cars, music and all things computers.
							I love cars and currently own a 2017 370z. It's such an amazing car and I'm so blessed to have it. After I found
							out about my love for all things Tech.I learned more and more about computers until my next step was Coding.
							Which is what I'm doing now. I hope to be the best at anything and everything I do. Including Web Development and
							anyting I learn from that.
